# Custom User Snippet Generator for VSCode

This is a web application that I created to generate custom user snippets for Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Motivation

As a software engineering bootcamp student, I often found myself copying and pasting the same code snippets over and over again, such as the Jasmine testing library CDN. To solve this problem, I researched ways to generate custom user snippets for Visual Studio Code and came across Pawel Grzybek's snippet generator. Inspired by his work, I decided to create my own version of the generator to practice and reinforce my coding skills.

## Features

The custom user snippet generator currently has the following features:

-   Generate custom user snippets for Visual Studio Code
-   Copy the generated code snippet to the clipboard with one click

## Future Work

The custom user snippet generator is a work in progress, and I plan to add more features in the future, such as:

-   Choose from a list of popular code snippets or create your own
-   Ability to save generated snippets for later use
-   Option to edit or delete previously saved snippets
-   Integration with other text editors besides Visual Studio Code

## Usage
